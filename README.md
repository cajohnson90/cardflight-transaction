## Technical Plan

### Objective

Develop a Next.js application that enables users to input a transaction number, submit it to the server, retrieve the corresponding data on the server-side, and then render the results in a client-side component.

### Architecture Overview

#### Frontend (Client-Side):

- A React-based form component that allows users to input a transaction number.
- A submit button that triggers an HTTP request to the backend.
- A loading state to indicate that the data is being fetched.
- Display the result in a client-side component once the transaction data is successfully fetched from the server.

#### Backend (Server-Side):

- An API route in Next.js that handles the form submission.
- The API will process the transaction number, fetch data from an external or internal data source, and return the result in JSON format.

### State Management:

- The frontend will use React hooks and, and rendering results.
- A server-side component in Next.js will handle data fetching and rendering before sending the response to the client.

## Implementation Steps

### Frontend Form Component:

- Create a React component that contains an input field for the transaction number.
- Implement form validation to ensure the input meets the required format and is not empty.
- On form submission, trigger an asynchronous fetch request to the backend API with the transaction number as a parameter.

### Backend API Route (Server-Side):

- Implement a Next.js API route (/pages/api/transaction.js) that processes the transaction number.
- The route should handle:
- Input validation (e.g., ensuring the transaction number is valid).
- Data fetching (from a database, external API, etc.).
- Return the result as a JSON object.

### Server-Side Data Fetching:

- Utilize Next.js's built-in API routes for server-side logic.
- Use libraries like axios or fetch to query the data source.

### Client-Side Data Rendering:

- Upon successful data fetch, render the results in a React component (e.g., ProcessedTransaction).
- Manage loading and error states for a seamless user experience.

## Unit Testing Strategy

- Testing Framework: Use Jest for unit testing to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application.

### Frontend Testing:

- Form Component Tests:
  - Verify input field validation (e.g., ensuring required fields are not empty).
  - Test form submission behavior and edge cases.
- State Management Tests:
  - Mock the fetch request and test the state transitions (loading, success, error).
  - Ensure that the data is correctly displayed once fetched.
- Backend Testing:
  - API Route Tests:
  - Mock external API/database calls and test the response handling.
  - Test edge cases (e.g., invalid transaction number, missing data).
  - Validate correct HTTP status codes and error handling (e.g., 404, 500).
- Test Coverage:
  - Aim for 80%+ test coverage for both the frontend and backend components.
  - Include integration tests to ensure smooth interaction between the frontend and backend.
- Mocking External Calls:
  - Use libraries like `jest-mock` or `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to mock external APIs or database calls during tests.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
